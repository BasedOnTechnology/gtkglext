	* Win32 target works!

	* gdk/gdkglconfig.h: 
	* gdk/x11/gdkglconfig-x11.c (gdk_gl_config_new): 
	* gdk/win32/gdkglconfig-win32.c (gdk_gl_config_new): It's
	interface is changed for Win32. Win32 ChoosePixelFormat ()
	requires target window's HDC, and now gdk_gl_config_new () needs
	taking a realized GdkWindow instance.
